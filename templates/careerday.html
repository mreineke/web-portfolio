                <h1>Career Day App</h1>
                <h2>The purpose of the Career Day application is to sort students into groups assigned to various Career Day presenters. The goals of this program are to consolidate all of the sorting and viewing of the students in one place, and to minimize the amount of work done by hand.</h2>
                <h1>Information Team</h1>
                <h2>The purpose of the Information Team is to retrieve data from spreadsheets (.csv files) and load the data into respective ArrayLists. After loading these Lists, we pass the data on to the Logic Team, where it is sorted. Liam, Ryan and I met many of our goals such as creating objects (such as the Student and Session classes) from spreadsheets using loading methods , exporting/saving .event files, and creating a class to store all the data (Event). My personal goals were to learn how big projects like this are strung together and become comfortable with reading and writing files. I accomplished both of these main goals and went beyond my own expectations. I learned Git, I learned the fine art of saving data to a file, and I realized the importance of coding for efficiency and readability (because I'm not the only one interpreting my code). My first real difficulty was creating the getGradeFromEmail() method for the Student class. I became very close with my backspace key. After a little while I finally found the key and completed the method, coding to ensure it would work for any current year. Another tough feat was organizing and formatting the methods that took data in from a .csv file and loaded it into an ArrayList. I ended up basically combining the method that retrieves the file name with the method that assigns each comma separated value to a variable and then loaded the variables into an object. 
                    In short, this project was essential to me in the sense that it taught me how to code with a team. This is my biggest takeaway from this project because I know I can make beautiful programs with others. When faced with difficulties, my team came together and crushed the problem. Not only was this one of the most useful learning experiences of my learning career, but it also gave me a snapshot of what real programming is like.
